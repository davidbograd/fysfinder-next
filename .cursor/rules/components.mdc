# Frontend Guidelines
- Always prefer functional React components (no class components).
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes consistently.
- Avoid inline styles; use CSS modules if custom styles are necessary.
- Components should have clear, descriptive naming.


# UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

# React component sizes
- React components should not exceed 300 lines. All designs should use a component approach so that they are easier to work on and fix without breaking other features.
