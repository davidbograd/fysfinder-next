# MRI Report Translator - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The MRI Report Translator is a tool that helps Danish patients understand their MRI reports by translating technical medical terminology into plain, easy-to-understand Danish language. This tool will leverage OpenAI's GPT API to provide accurate, user-friendly translations of medical text.

## User Problem

Medical reports, particularly MRI reports, are written in technical language that can be difficult for patients to understand. This can lead to anxiety and confusion about their medical condition. Patients need a way to quickly understand what their reports mean in simple terms.

## Solution

A web-based tool that allows users to input sections of their MRI report and receive an easy-to-understand translation in Danish. The translation will maintain medical accuracy while using simpler language and providing helpful context where necessary.

## User Experience

### Core Features

- Simple, clean interface with clear instructions in Danish
- Text input area for MRI report content
- Translation button
- Results display area
- Option to copy translated text

### User Flow

1. User arrives at the translation page
2. User inputs text from their MRI report
3. User clicks "Translate" button
4. System processes the text using GPT
5. Translated result is displayed below

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation

- [x] Create new Next.js page for the translator tool
- [x] Implement basic UI components (input, button, result area)
- [x] Set up OpenAI API integration
- [x] Create basic prompt engineering for accurate medical translations in Danish
- [x] Implement error handling for API calls
- [x] Add loading states

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX

- [x] Add input character limit and counter
- [x] Add input validation
- [x] Create helpful placeholder text and examples in Danish
- [x] Add progress indicator during translation
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile devices

### Phase 3: Safety and Reliability

- [ ] Add disclaimer about medical advice in Danish
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Create fallback UI states
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
- [ ] Implement logging for translation requests

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization

- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Optimize API response caching
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanism
- [ ] Create help/FAQ section in Danish
- [ ] Optimize for accessibility

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Next.js App Router
- React Server Components where possible
- Shadcn UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Backend

- OpenAI API integration with Danish language optimization
- Environment variables for API keys
- Rate limiting middleware
- Error handling middleware

### Security

- Input sanitization
- API key protection
- Rate limiting per user/session
- Secure headers

## Success Metrics

- User engagement (time on page)
- Translation success rate
- Average response time
- User feedback scores
- Error rate
- Usage patterns

## Future Considerations

- Save translation history
- Export functionality
- Integration with medical record systems
- Batch translation capability
- Medical terminology glossary in Danish

## Notes

- All medical translations should include a disclaimer
- Regular review of OpenAI's usage policies and costs
- Monitor and adjust prompt engineering based on user feedback
